# skybright

Sky light, sky bright,

Only sky I'll see tonight,

I wish I may, I wish I might,

Know the sky I'll see tonight.


`skybright` is a tool for esitamting the sky brightness (in
magnitudes/asec^2) of a given set of celestial coordinates, from a
given site, at a given time, in a given filter.

It use a simple model with four components:

1. An airglow shell in the Earth's atmosphere
2. Rayleigh scattering of moonlight
3. Mie scattering of moonlight
4. A very simple algebraic estimation of twilight.
